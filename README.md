# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the browser. 

## How it Works (Algorithm)
The algorithm evaluates the game board in three steps:
1. Tries to win the game with the next move.
2. If not possible, it blocks the opponent's winning move.
3. If neither is an option, it picks a random empty cell.
